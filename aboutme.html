    <p id="aboutme">I am a first-generation college student and Chilean-American, with an ambition to succeed in the field of computer science. I'm very driven and have a strong passion for both CS and music, and plan on trying to bridge both these passions at some point during my professional or academic career.</p>
    <p id="aboutme">I have grown up in a variety of different environments that I believe have helped me build a unique perspective on life and its intricacies. I ask probing questions and highly value a deep understanding of concepts so that I can apply my knowledge with fluidity. Using my background, I try my best to communicate effectively and have a knack for working in teams but I will embrace any working environment while always striving for self-improvement.</p>
